Introduction
============

This BLE SDK for iOS provides a framework for Mac OSX and iOS developers to develop Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (aka BLE) Apps easily using a simple TXRX Service for exchanging data. It is based on Apple's CoreBluetooth framework.

It currently supports iOS 7 and Mac OSX 10.9.2.<br/>
OSX 10.7.5, 10.8.x and iOS 6 also support BLE but not tested.<br/>
OSX 10.9.0 and 10.9.1 have bugs, so we will not support.<br/>

For iOS devices, only iPhone 4s/5/5s, iPod touch 5 and iPad 3/4/Air/Mini have BLE 4.0 support.<br/>
For Mac devices, if no BLE hardware built-in, you need to buy an USB Bluetooth 4.0 dongle (CSR or Broadcom).<br/>

Since BLE is a new technology and if you find your App does not run correctly, restart your device.

The examples are for our BLE development boards, currently, it supports:<br/>
- BLE Shield
- BLE Mini
- Blend Micro
- Blend
- BLE Nano
- RBL nRF51822
